# Roaming_Recruitment
An app that lets you connect with recruiters on a short notice.

This is being made (initially anyway) to give people who are looking for jobs a new way to connect and set up meetings with 
recruiters or even people who are hiring. The idea is this:

Suppose you are a programmer and you want to go to a local coffee shop to do some work and enjoy a coffee. While you're there you can sign
on the app and check in. While at the same time you can have a recruiter or somebody who might be hiring near you on lunch. They can open the app
and see that you are available and near them. Then instead of going through the dreaded email process of setting something up, that person 
just can directly contact you and set up a quick informal meeting for a couple minutes.
